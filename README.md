# CameraMultiViewer
Hi, I made this app for viewing multiple cameras I have set up on an SMT Assembly (pick and place) Machine. But others may find it useful as well.

It can be used for eye tracking, please view the video below.

It uses the AForge.net and EmguCV's openCV wrapper for obtaining the USB video streams and conducting machine vision processing. Cuda is used when available.
