# USBCameraMultiViewer
A windows app for viewing multiple video streams from USB cameras. You can rotate and mirror the images and also use a variety of filters. Easily take screenshots. Very useful for c270 hacks.

Hi, I made this app for viewing multiple cameras I have set up on an SMT Assembly (pick and place) Machine. But others may find it useful as well.
It uses the AForge.net nuget package for obtaining the USB video streams. Multiple instances can be run to view more than 2 USB streams.
